abstract = {We present a new, affordable version of TanGeoMS, a tangible geospatial modeling and visualization system designed for collaboratively exploring how terrain change impacts landscape processes. It couples a physical, three-dimensional model of a landscape with geospatial modeling and analysis through a cycle of scanning and projection. Multiple users can modify the physical model by hand while it is being scanned; by sculpting the model they generate input for modeling of geophysical processes. The modeling results are then visualized by projecting images or animations back on the physical model. This feedback loop is an intuitive way to evaluate the impacts of different scenarios including anthropogenic and natural landscape change. Integration with GRASS GIS, a free and open source geographic information system, provides TanGeoMS with a variety of easily accessible geospatial analysis and modeling tools. To demonstrate the environmental modeling applications of TanGeoMS, we will demonstrate how development can be planned based on feedback from landscape processes such as hydrologic simulation and wildfire modeling with variable fuel distribution.},

@article{tateosian2010,
abstract = {We present TanGeoMS, a tangible geospatial modeling visualization system that couples a laser scanner, projector, and a flexible physical three-dimensional model with a standard geospatial information system (GIS) to create a tangible user interface for terrain data. TanGeoMS projects an image of real-world data onto a physical terrain model. Users can alter the topography of the model by modifying the clay surface or placing additional objects on the surface. The modified model is captured by an overhead laser scanner then imported into a GIS for analysis and simulation of real-world processes. The results are projected back onto the surface of the model providing feedback on the impact of the modifications on terrain parameters and simulated processes. Interaction with a physical model is highly intuitive, allowing users to base initial design decisions on geospatial data, test the impact of these decisions in GIS simulations, and use the feedback to improve their design. We demonstrate the system on three applications: investigating runoff management within a watershed, assessing the impact of storm surge on barrier islands, and exploring landscape rehabilitation in military training areas.},

@article{Mitasova2006,
abstract = {Emerging technologies that combine the flexibility of digital landscape representation with easy-to-interpret 3D physical models open new possibilities for user interaction with geospatial data. A prototype tangible geospatial modeling environment lets users interact with landscape analysis and simulations using a tangible physical model. We introduce a concept that builds upon previous independent tangible user interface (TUI) and terrain analysis research and aims at more intuitive collaborative interaction with digital landscape data},
